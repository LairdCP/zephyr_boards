Power Amplifier/Low Noise Amplifier (PA/LNA)
============================================

The PA version of the BL5340 module incorporates a PA/LNA for long range
applications. This is based upon the Nordic nRF21540 Front End Module.

Refer to the `Nordic nRF21540 datasheet`_ for further details.

Security components
===================

- Implementation Defined Attribution Unit (`IDAU`_) on the Application MCU.
  The IDAU is implemented with the System Protection Unit and is used to
  define secure and non-secure memory maps.  By default, all of the memory
  space  (Flash, SRAM, and peripheral address space) is defined to be secure
  accessible only.
- Secure boot.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The BL5340 DVK Application MCU supports the Armv8m Security Extension.
Applications built for the bl5340_dvk_cpuapp board by default
boot in the Secure state.

The BL5340 DVK Network MCU does not support the Armv8m Security Extension.
nRF5340 IDAU may configure bus accesses by the nRF5340 Network MCU
to have Secure attribute set; the latter allows to build and run
Secure only applications on the nRF5340 SoC.

Building Secure/Non-Secure Zephyr applications
==============================================

The process requires the following steps:

1. Build the Secure Zephyr application for the Application MCU
   using ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk_cpuapp`` and
   ``CONFIG_TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE=y`` in the application
   project configuration file.
2. Build the Non-Secure Zephyr application for the Application MCU
   using ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk_cpuappns``.
3. Merge the two binaries together.
4. Build the application firmware for the Network MCU using
   ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk_cpunet``.

When building a Secure/Non-Secure application for the BL5340 DVK Application
MCU, the Secure application will have to set the IDAU (SPU) configuration to
allow Non-Secure access to all CPU resources utilized by the Non-Secure
application firmware. SPU configuration shall take place before jumping to the
Non-Secure application.

Building a Secure only application
==================================

Build the Zephyr app in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run`), using ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk_cpuapp`` for
the firmware running on the BL5340 Application MCU, and using
``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk_cpunet`` for the firmware running
on the BL5340 Network MCU.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application running on the
BL5340 DVK Application MCU.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the BL5340 DVK board
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: bl5340_dvk_cpuapp
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging a BL5340 DVK
board with a Segger IC.


Testing Bluetooth on the BL5340 DVK
***********************************
Many of the Bluetooth examples will work on the BL5340 DVK.
